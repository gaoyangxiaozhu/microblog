microblog
=======
I recently spent three days to learn node.js using 'node.js开发指南.pdf',and it's just my start for node.
and I met with many problems when I write microblog program according to the book,beacuse the express version using in this program is so old.
so  I rewrite a new microblog program useing express 4.12.1
and now it can run in my computer perfectly ,so I push it on my github.
and I hope this can be help and reference to the beginners like me
